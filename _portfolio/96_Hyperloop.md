After completing my bachelor's, I spent a year as lead propulsion engineer in the [Delft Hyperloop](https://www.delfthyperloop.nl/) Dreamteam. My responsibilities included managing human, financial and time resources, as well as performing full time engineering work. My department was responsible for the motor and motor drives on the vehicle. During our [final tests](https://youtu.be/GZaZEuLtcPM?t=2891) we achieved a top speed of 360 km/h on a track only 300 meters long!

We reached record-breaking speeds by testing our propulsion system extensively. For our tests it was crucial to gain insights into currents, temperatures and torque outputs of our motors. In order to gain these insights I developed a MATLAB plotting tool which interfaced with the data available from our motor drives. The tool also allowed us to run simulations based on the acquired data and compare the simulations to the real data. An overview of the GUI of this tool is shown below.
