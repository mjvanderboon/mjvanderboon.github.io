For my final project in high school, I wanted to work with AI. I was always fascinated by videos of AI solving complex tasks and I wanted to see what I could do. We chose the well-known travelling salesman problem and tried to approach it using the concept of genetic algorithms. We developed a GUI in C# and the results were better than we expected! The video below explains the application in more detail.
