Working as an independent software consultant from Boon & Bytes, my own company, I helped Park&Charge evolve into a data-driven company. My project focused on developing and deploying optimization software that redefined how the company scheduled repairs for charging poles, ensuring the most efficient routes for mechanics. 

This project not only streamlined operations but also demonstrated the impact of strategic software solutions on operational efficiency, all while applying best practice techniques and seamless integration into their existing systems.
