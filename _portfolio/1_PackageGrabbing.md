Reinforcement learning for robotics usually entails extensive reward engineering and tuning in order to generate policies which are feasible to apply on a physical platform. In this thesis, I investigate using curiosity-based methods to allow for sparse task and reward formulations that generate succesfull policies which are feasible to deploy. The idea is that by enabling sparse reward formulations to be more succesful, the research for applying RL to different tasks is accelerated.

As a platform this research, the ANYmal on Wheels robot is used. This versatile wheeled-legged robot has previously shown to be capable to stand up on the hind legs, freeing up the front legs for object manipulation.

In the thesis my responsibilities include setting up the RL task formulation, researching and developing curiosity-based exploration methods, as well as integrating the camera hardware required for the package grabbing task onto the existing ANYmal on wheels robot.
