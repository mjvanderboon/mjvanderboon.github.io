During my 6 months at Stekker, I built an ML pipeline for forecasting electricity prices, a key feature for the business. While developing and deploying this software, I expanded my skill set by learning Ruby and applied best practice CI/CD techniques for a smooth deployment process.

Beyond the the ML platform for electricity price forecasts, I played a crucial role in overhauling Stekker's underlying engine for charge planning, contributing to significant enhancements. This revamp not only improved current functionalities but also expanded the future possibilities of what the platform can achieve.
