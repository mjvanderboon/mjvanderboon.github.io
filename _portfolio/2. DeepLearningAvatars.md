During my internship as TNO, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, I worked on deep learning augmented avatars for VR applications. I gained experience developing DL models from scratch and integrating them for inference in real-time pipelines. A paper describing the pipeline was published to the ACM Conference on Interactive Media Experiences (IMX 22). I presented the paper on the conference in Aveiro, Portugal in June 2022.

My work consists of a GAN based VR headset removal system for teleconferencing applications. The pipeline consists of a blendshape-based avatar combined with two deep learning improvements. The frst improvement module runs ofine and improves the texture map of the base avatar. The second module runs inference in real-time at the rendering stage and performs a style transfer to the avatarâ€™s eyes.

The style transfer module is integrated into Unity using the Unity Barracuda package. The deep learning models were all written in PyTorch.
