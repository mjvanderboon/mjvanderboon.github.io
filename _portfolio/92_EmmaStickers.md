While AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney are opening new doors for customization and efficiency, their true potential often goes untapped, largely because they're not incorporated in the apps we use every day. Recognizing this gap, I took on the challenge of making AI more accessible and engaging.

I developed a web app that bridges the gap between everyday communication and AI's creative power. This app integrates seamlessly with WhatsApp and leverages the power of DALL-E to turn conversations into custom WhatsApp stickers. Built on a serverless Firebase backend, it connects with WhatsApp, ChatGPT and DALL-E. Users chat with Emma, a friendly AI, whose responses are not just text but unique stickers created on-the-fly by DALL-E. Starting off with 10 free credits, users can easily buy more via a Stripe payment.

To streamline management and support, I also built a React-based admin interface. This tool allows for direct interaction with users, making it simple to address their needs or queries.

Though this project started as a hobby, it didn't take off as hoped. Yet, it proved a valuable point: integrating AI into familiar platforms can greatly enhance user experience. More importantly, I learned a lot about developing and deploying web apps.
