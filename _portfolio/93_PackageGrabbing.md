Reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics usually entails extensive reward engineering and tuning in order to generate policies which are feasible to apply on a physical platform. In this thesis, I investigated using curiosity-based methods to allow for sparser task and reward formulations that still generate successful policies which are feasible to deploy. The idea is that by enabling sparse reward formulations, the research for applying RL to robotics for different tasks is accelerated.

As a platform for this research, the ANYmal on Wheels robot was used. This versatile wheeled-legged robot has previously shown to be capable of standing up on the hind legs, freeing up the front legs for object manipulation.

In the thesis my responsibilities included setting up the RL task formulation, researching and developing curiosity-based exploration methods, as well as integrating the camera hardware required for the package grabbing task onto the existing ANYmal on wheels robot.
