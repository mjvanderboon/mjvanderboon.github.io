Hi!

My name is Matthijs. I am from the Netherlands and currently study robotics on a scholarship from ETH Zurich. During the master's I performed a 6 month internship at TNO, the Dutch organisation for applied scientific research. I also worked for a year as lead propulsion engineer in the Delft Hyperloop team. Before coming to Zurich, I did a bachelor's in mechanical engineering. During my minor I spent 6 months abroad in Vancouver, Canada on a scholarship from the Delft university of Technology.

These days, I am passionate about using AI to do all sorts of things. Specifically, I believe the embodiment of AI has great potential to change our daily lives for the better. Feel free to take a look at my [portfolio](portfolio.html) to see some projects I worked on.
