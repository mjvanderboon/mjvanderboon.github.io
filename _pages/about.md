Hi!

My name is Matthijs. I am from the Netherlands and I currently work as Associate at BCG in the Technology and Digital Advantage practice area. I studied robotics in Switzerland on a scholarship from ETH Zurich. During the master's I performed a 6 month internship at TNO, the Dutch organisation for applied scientific research. I also worked for a year as lead propulsion engineer in the Delft Hyperloop team. Before coming to Zurich, I did a bachelor's in mechanical engineering. During my minor I spent 6 months abroad in Vancouver, Canada on a scholarship from the Delft university of Technology.

I enjoy playing piano and have been doing so for over 15 years. My focus here is on classical music. Aside from that I enjoy weightlifting to stay fit both physically and mentally. Feel free to take a look at my [portfolio](portfolio.html) to see some of the projects I worked on!
