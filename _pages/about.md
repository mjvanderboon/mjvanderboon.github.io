Hi!

My name is Matthijs. I am from the Netherlands and I currently work as an associate at BCG in the technology and digital advantage practice area. Before joining BCG, I worked at a start-up in the electric vehicle space, [Stekker](https://www.stekker.com/), as an AI developer. At Stekker, I mainly focused on electricity price forecasting using machine learning. I studied robotics in Switzerland on a scholarship from ETH Zurich. During my master's, I performed a six-month internship at TNO (the Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research). I also worked for a year as lead propulsion engineer in the Delft Hyperloop student team. Before coming to Zurich, I completed a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. During my minor, I spent six months abroad in Vancouver, Canada, on a scholarship from the Delft University of Technology.

I enjoy playing piano and have been doing so for over 15 years. My focus here is on classical music. Aside from that I enjoy weightlifting to stay fit both physically and mentally. Feel free to take a look at my [portfolio](portfolio.html) to see some of the projects I worked on!
